# UHai

**UHai** is a Kenyan digital anthropology studio and cultural tech lab. We create AI personas and develop African avatar assets rooted in the complexity, beauty, and brilliance of Black identity.

Our mission is to ensure that in the future of tech — whether in animation, AI, or the metaverse — African features, textures, and experiences are not an afterthought, but the foundation.

### 👁️ Vision
To reclaim and reimagine how African identity is represented in the digital world — from every curl, freckle, nose shape, and skin tone to the untold stories behind them.

---

### 🌀 What We Do

- **AI Personas**: We build emotionally intelligent digital characters grounded in cultural anthropology:
  - **Momi** – An AI maternal identity exploring motherhood, matrescence, and memory.

- **Afro Avatar Identity Assets**:  
  A growing visual library focused on true representation — 4C hair, locs, diverse undertones, facial features, and cultural styles that reflect real African lives.

-**Cultural Prototyping**:
We explore and prototype digital identities through Afro-centered storytelling and design. Our work reimagines how African cultures are expressed, represented, and experienced in virtual spaces.

### 🌍 Why It Matters
Most tech and avatar platforms reflect a narrow, Western default. UHAI is here to change that — one Black digital identity at a time.
