# UH.AI
UHAI is a Kenyan digital anthropology studio exploring AI identities through cultural storytelling and technology.
# UHAI

**UHAI** is Kenya’s first digital anthropology studio exploring the intersection of culture, identity, and artificial intelligence.

We create AI-powered personas that tell stories rooted in African lived experiences — reshaping how the continent is seen, imagined, and represented online.

### 👁️ Vision
To build soulful, culturally rooted AI identities that reflect the complexity, beauty, and brilliance of African lives.

### 🌀 Our Projects
- **Momi** – The first AI persona of UHAI: a maternal identity exploring motherhood, matrescence, and memory.
- **[Coming Soon]** – Our second AI persona, inspired by Kenyan pop culture and Gen Z digital rebellion.

### 🌍 Why It Matters
UHAI challenges the limits of representation in tech by creating anthropologically grounded, emotionally intelligent AI voices from the continent.
