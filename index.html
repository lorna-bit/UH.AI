    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>UHAI is a cultural tech lab building a future where African identities are not an afterthought — they are the blueprint. We experiment with digital storytelling, Afro-centered design, and cultural prototyping to shape a future where AI reflects the fullness of Black life.</p>

    <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
    <p>Most digital avatar apps and AI systems offer only the surface — skin tone. But Blackness is more than pigment. It's texture, language, rhythm, resistance, and memory. UHAI challenges generic representation and offers something deeper: AI personas born from African cultural logic.</p>

    <h2>Our Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Momi:</strong> An AI mother inspired by matrescence — the transformation into motherhood, rooted in African anthropology and tenderness.</li>
      <li><strong>[Coming Soon]</strong> Second AI persona grounded in Afro-futurism, rebellion, and beauty without compromise.</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural Prototyping:</strong> We create and test Afro-centered digital identities using code, narrative, and aesthetics.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What We’re Building</h2>
    <p>An app (or platform) that offers AI characters with authentic African hair, features, and stories — not just brown skins with Eurocentric styles. Our goal is a Black-led AI ecosystem where representation is real.</p>
